An AI-powered Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) agent that collaborates with users in real-time to diagnose and resolve infrastructure incidents. Built on the Cloudflare Developer Platform.

## 🚀 Live Demo
**[Insert your .pages.dev link here]**

## 🛠️ Architecture
This project uses the "Edge-Native" stack to ensure low latency and stateful collaboration:
* **LLM:** `Llama 3.3` running on **Workers AI** for intelligent analysis.
* **Coordination:** **Cloudflare Workers** act as the entry point and router.
* **State & Memory:** **Durable Objects** maintain the chat history and the live "Defcon" status (Normal vs Critical) across all connected users.
* **Frontend:** A WebSocket-enabled UI hosted on **Cloudflare Pages**.

## ✨ Features
1.  **Real-time Chat:** Low-latency communication via WebSockets.
2.  **Agentic Capabilities:** The AI can autonomously trigger UI changes.
    * *Try it:* Tell the agent "The server is down!" and watch the dashboard turn red.
3.  **State Management:** The incident status persists in the Durable Object.
